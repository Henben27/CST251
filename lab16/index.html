			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> Had a probem with the backround images and found out they only worked
				while in the same folder as the CSS file. I had a bit of trouble getting
				each header to be over their own columns.

			<div id="Result">
				<h2>Result</h2>
				<p>The result is the backrounds having images, the text being in columns,
					 and the image expanding with a transition effect and the border changing color.
